Hi! I'm a PhD student in the [Computational Science and Engineering program](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-computational-science-and-engineering) at Georgia Tech College of Computing, advised by [Dr. Xiuwei Zhang](https://xiuweizhang.wordpress.com/). 
Before starting my PhD, I did my Master's degree in computational biology at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/) (’22) and my bachelor's double majored in biology and data science at China Agricultural University (’20).

My research interests broadly center on the application of AI models to single-cell and spatial omics. Specifically, my current work includes (1) cell label transfer and perturbed cell detection in single-cell data and (2) predicting transcriptomic signals from histology images.
